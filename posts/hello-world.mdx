## Hello, World!

I have been working on this personal blog website for quite sometime now and it's finally time to say it - hello, world! 

Just like a lot of people who try to start a blog, I have the same gripe - Do I have enough content to publish? What do I even write about? To be completely honest with you, I'm not really sure about the direction I want to take with my blog. I would love to write about some of the tech that I'm working with on a daily basis, whilst also sharing my exploits as a digital nomad. So here's my plan:

* I want to write consistently. I am going to set a cadence for publishing new posts, and try my best to stick to it.
* I want to actively maintain a snippets page (coming soon!). Think of it as ready to use code snippets for some cool problems that I come across while programming.
* I will try my best to have some variety in the content. My goal is not to become a specialist in one particular area, but rather explore mulitiple domains and share what I learn along the way.

And that's the plan! (for now, at least). So if you are seeing this post, I'm happy to say that my writing journey has officially started! Stay tuned!
